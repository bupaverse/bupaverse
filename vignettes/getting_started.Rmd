# Getting Started with bupaR

The **bupaverse** (alias **bupaR** [@janssenswillenBupaREnablingReproducible2019]) is an open-source, integrated suite
of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/)-packages [@Rcore] for handling and analysing business process data, developed by the
[Business Informatics Research Group](https://www.uhasselt.be/binf) at Hasselt University, Belgium. Profoundly inspired
by the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [@wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019] package, the **bupaverse** package
is designed to facilitate the installation and loading of multiple **bupaverse** packages in a single step.

## bupaverse Package

The **bupaverse** is a collection of packages that can be conveniently installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
using a single `R` command:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bupaverse")
```

This will install the "core" packages that are required to start with business process analytics in `R`. Currently, the
"core" contains the following packages:

* [**bupaR**](https://bupaverse.github.io/bupaR/): Core package for business process analysis.
* [**edeaR**](https://bupaverse.github.io/edeaR/): Exploratory and descriptive analysis of event-based data.
* [**eventdataR**](https://bupaverse.github.io/eventdataR/): Repository of sample process data.
* [**processcheckR**](https://bupaverse.github.io/processcheckR/): Rule-based conformance checking and filtering.
* [**processmapR**](https://bupaverse.github.io/processmapR/): Visualise event-based data using, i.a., process maps.

To start using these packages, you can load them all using a single `R` command:

```{r load}
library(bupaverse)
```

In addition to attaching the "core" packages, this command also reports which package versions were loaded and conflicts
with previously loaded packages.

`install.packages("bupaverse")` also installs "non-core" packages which are required for **bupaverse** to function.
The "non-core" packages include: [**cli**](https://cli.r-lib.org) [@Rcli], [**glue**](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) [@Rglue],
[**magrittr**](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) [@Rmagrittr], [**purrr**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) [@Rpurrr],
and [**rlang**](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) [@Rrlang]. Note that these packages are not attached by `library(bupaverse)`.

## Example

After the package has been loaded, you can start analysing process data, e.g., you can analyse and plot the processing time
for each activity in the sample dataset `eventdataR::patients`. Learn more about **bupaverse** at the
[bupaR.net](https://bupar.net/) homepage.

```{r example}
patients %>%
  processing_time(level = "activity") %>%
  plot()
```

framework by submitting issues and pull requests on the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bupaverse).
